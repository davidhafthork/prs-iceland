# Cursor Visibility Solutions

## The Issue
Custom SVG cursors often don't render properly in browsers. You're right - you're just seeing the default cursor because the browser couldn't render the complex SVG cursors I tried to create.

## Current Solution
I've removed the broken custom cursors and instead focused on making interactive elements more obvious:

1. **Hover effects** - Interactive elements now show subtle blue outlines when you hover
2. **White text cursor** - Input fields use a white caret for visibility
3. **Visual feedback** - Better hover states so you know where your cursor is

## Alternative Options

If the default cursor is still hard to see on your dark background, try these:

### Option 1: Crosshair Cursor (Most Visible)
Add this to your CSS or in a `<style>` tag:
```css
* {
    cursor: crosshair !important;
}
```

### Option 2: OS-Level Solution (Recommended)
**Windows:**
- Settings → Ease of Access → Mouse pointer
- Choose "Large" or "Extra Large" size
- Select white or inverted color scheme

**macOS:**
- System Preferences → Accessibility → Display
- Pointer → "Pointer size" slider
- Enable "Shake mouse pointer to locate"

### Option 3: Browser Extensions
- "Custom Cursor" extensions let you upload your own cursor
- "Big Cursor" extensions increase cursor size
- Search your browser's extension store

### Option 4: CSS-Only Enhancement
Already implemented - interactive elements show blue glow on hover:
- Buttons get blue outline
- Links get underline
- Inputs get blue border

## Why Custom Cursors Failed

1. **SVG Complexity** - Browsers limit SVG cursor complexity
2. **Data URI Issues** - Special characters need proper encoding  
3. **Size Limits** - Cursors larger than 128x128px often fail
4. **Browser Support** - Not all browsers support SVG cursors

## Testing
The current solution uses:
- Standard system cursors (guaranteed to work)
- Enhanced hover states (visual feedback)
- Better contrast through UI elements

This approach is more reliable than custom cursors and provides better accessibility.
