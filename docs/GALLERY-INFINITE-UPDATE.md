# ðŸŽ¨ Gallery Update: Custom Cursor & Infinite Scroll

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Autoplay**
- No more automatic sliding every 4 seconds
- Gallery only moves when user interacts with it

### 2. **Added Infinite Scroll**
- When you reach the last image and swipe/drag right, it loops back to the first image
- When you're on the first image and swipe/drag left, it goes to the last image
- Creates a seamless, continuous browsing experience

### 3. **Custom Flickity-Style Cursor**
- Added a custom crosshair cursor that appears when hovering over the gallery
- White crosshair with mix-blend-mode for visibility on any background
- Changes to orange when dragging
- Follows your mouse movement

### 4. **Implementation Details**

#### In `index.html`:
- Added inline gallery fix script with all new features
- Custom cursor element created dynamically
- Infinite scroll logic in the `goToSlide` function

#### In `js/gallery.js`:
- Complete module rewrite with infinite scroll support
- Custom cursor implementation
- Removed all autoplay code
- Clean event handling

#### Visual Features:
- **Hover**: White crosshair cursor appears
- **Dragging**: Cursor changes to orange, smaller size
- **Indicator**: Small "â†” Infinite scroll" text below gallery
- **Smooth transitions**: 0.4s cubic-bezier animations

### 5. **How It Works Now**

**Mouse/Touch:**
- Click/touch and drag left = Next image (wraps to first after last)
- Click/touch and drag right = Previous image (wraps to last from first)

**Keyboard:**
- Arrow Left = Previous image (with wrap)
- Arrow Right = Next image (with wrap)

**Visual Feedback:**
- Custom crosshair cursor on hover
- Grab cursor as fallback
- Smooth transitions between slides

## Testing

The gallery should now:
1. Show a custom crosshair cursor when you hover
2. Allow infinite scrolling in both directions
3. Not auto-advance slides
4. Work with mouse, touch, and keyboard
