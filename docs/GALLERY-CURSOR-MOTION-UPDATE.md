# üéØ Gallery Cursor Update: Motion Effects Without Arrows

## What Changed

### Removed Confusing Arrows
- ‚ùå No more arrows pointing in the opposite direction of movement
- ‚ùå No motion trails that could be misinterpreted

### New Motion Feedback
The cursor now uses **shape transformation** to indicate movement:

1. **When Dragging Left** (content moves right):
   - Ring stretches horizontally and skews
   - Becomes more oval-shaped leaning right
   - Color intensifies to deeper orange (#ff3300)
   - Shadow appears on the left side
   - Center dot shifts left (opposite to content movement)

2. **When Dragging Right** (content moves left):
   - Ring stretches and skews the opposite way
   - Oval shape leans left
   - Same color intensification
   - Shadow appears on the right side
   - Center dot shifts right

3. **Static/Hovering**:
   - Perfect circle
   - Normal orange color (#ff6716)
   - Center dot perfectly centered

## Visual Logic
The cursor now "leans into" the drag direction, like a ball being pulled:
- Drag left ‚Üí Cursor stretches/leans right (like it's being pulled)
- Drag right ‚Üí Cursor stretches/leans left

This creates a more intuitive visual feedback that doesn't conflict with the content movement direction.

## Technical Details

**Transform Effects**:
```css
/* Left movement */
transform: scale(1.3, 0.8) skewX(10deg);

/* Right movement */
transform: scale(1.3, 0.8) skewX(-10deg);
```

**Visual Enhancements**:
- Box shadow follows the movement direction
- Color becomes more vibrant when moving
- Dot displacement creates a "weight" effect

## Result
The cursor now provides clear movement feedback without confusing directional indicators. It feels more organic and responsive, like a physical object reacting to the drag motion!
