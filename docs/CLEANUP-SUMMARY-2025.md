# PRS Iceland Project Cleanup Summary

## 📁 Recommended File Organization

### Files to Archive (Move to `docs/archive/`)

#### Gallery Fix Documentation (11 files)
These represent multiple iterations of gallery fixes and should be archived:
- `docs/GALLERY-BLANK-FIX.md`
- `docs/GALLERY-BLOB-OPTIMIZATION.md`
- `docs/GALLERY-COMPLETE-FIX.md`
- `docs/GALLERY-CURSOR-MOTION-UPDATE.md`
- `docs/GALLERY-CURSOR-NO-SPIN.md`

#### Other Fix Documentation (6 files)
General fix attempts that are no longer needed:
- `docs/ABOUT-SECTION-FIX.md`
- `docs/FIX-SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/CLEANUP-COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/backup-critical-fixes.css`
- `docs/backup-debug-header.css`
- `docs/backup-final-fix.css`

#### Outdated CSS Files
After Phase 2 confirms the new architecture works, consider archiving:
- `css/color-fix-override.css` (being replaced by new color system)
- `css/final-design-fix.css` (more patches)
- `css/design-fixes.css` (patches)
- `css/gallery-fix.css` (gallery patches)

### Files to Keep

- `docs/CSS-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Current architecture docs
- `docs/DATA-FIRST-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation guide
- `docs/FINAL-STRUCTURE.md` - Project structure

- `docs/README-GOOGLE-SHEETS.md` - Google Sheets integration
- `docs/README-NAVIGATION.md` - Navigation docs
- `docs/color-migration-plan.md` - Active migration plan (Phase 1)

#### Active Directories

- `test/` - Test pages (actively used)
- `debug/` - Debug tools (useful)
- `pages/` - Production pages
- `js/` - JavaScript files

## 🎯 Immediate Actions

1. **Manual File Moves** (GitHub API doesn't support direct moves):
   ```bash
   # Create subdirectories in archive
   mkdir -p docs/archive/gallery-fixes
   mkdir -p docs/archive/design-fixes
   
   # Move gallery fixes
   mv docs/GALLERY-*.md docs/archive/gallery-fixes/
   
   # Move other fixes
   mv docs/*FIX*.md docs/archive/design-fixes/
   mv docs/backup-*.css docs/archive/design-fixes/
   ```

2. **Update .gitignore** (if needed):
   ```
   # Temporary files
   *.tmp
   *.bak
   
   # Old CSS files (after migration)
   css/*-fix.css
   css/*-override.css
   ```

3. **Create Archive README**:
   - Document what's in the archive
   - Explain why files were archived
   - Date of archival

## 📊 Cleanup Impact

### Before
- 23+ CSS files with overlapping concerns
- 17+ fix documentation files scattered in docs/
- Unclear which files are active vs obsolete

### After
- Clear separation: `refactored/` for new, `archive/` for old
- Active documentation easily identifiable
- Clean structure for Phase 2+ work

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Easy to see what's current vs archived
2. **History**: Preserves all work without cluttering active development
3. **Focus**: Developers can focus on refactored code
4. **Rollback**: Old files still available if needed

## 📝 Notes

- Don't delete files until refactoring is complete and tested
- Consider creating a `CHANGELOG.md` to track major changes
- Update README.md to reflect new structure
- Keep test files - they're useful for validation

This cleanup will make the refactoring process much cleaner and easier to manage!
