# ðŸŽ¯ Gallery Cursor Update: No More Spinning!

## What Changed

### Removed the Spinning Animation
- The rotating ring was confusing as it looked like a loading spinner
- Now the cursor has a **static orange ring** that doesn't rotate
- Much clearer that it's an interactive cursor, not a loading indicator

### What Remains
All the other cool cursor features are still there:

1. **Static Orange Ring**
   - Clean circular border
   - 80% opacity for subtlety
   - Smooth transitions

2. **Pulsing Effect**
   - Gentle pulse animation continues
   - Adds visual interest without confusion

3. **Interactive States**
   - **Normal**: Orange ring with center dot
   - **Dragging**: Ring scales up to 1.3x, full opacity, white center dot
   - **Movement**: Directional arrows appear when dragging left/right

4. **No Default Cursor**
   - Still completely custom cursor experience
   - No grab hand appears

## Visual Summary

**Before**: ðŸ”„ (spinning ring - looked like loading)  
**After**: â­• (static ring - clearly interactive)

The cursor is now less distracting while still being visually interesting and providing clear interaction feedback!

## Files Updated
- `pages/index.html` - Inline styles updated
- `js/gallery.js` - Module styles updated
- Removed all rotation animations and @keyframes

The seamless infinite scroll remains unchanged and works perfectly with the updated cursor.
