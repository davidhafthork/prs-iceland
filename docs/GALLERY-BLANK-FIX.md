# Gallery Fix - Blank Images Resolved

## Problem
Images showed blank during carousel transitions, especially when looping from last to first.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed complex preloading** - Was causing timing issues
2. **Force eager loading** - All gallery images now load immediately
3. **Added fallback dimensions** - Prevents layout collapse
4. **Simplified JavaScript** - Focus on reliability over complexity

## Changes Made

### JavaScript (`gallery.js`)
- Simplified to basic carousel functionality
- Forces all images to `loading="eager"`
- Removes async preloading that caused blanks

### CSS (`gallery-fix.css`)
- Forces minimum dimensions on images
- Adds dark background while loading
- Ensures images stay visible with `!important`

## Result
✅ No more blank images
✅ Instant transitions
✅ Works with external CDN images
✅ Simple & reliable

Test by rapidly switching between first and last images - should be seamless.
