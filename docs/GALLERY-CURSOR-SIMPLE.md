# ðŸŽ¯ Gallery Cursor: Simple & Clean

## What Changed

I heard you loud and clear - the shape morphing was weird! So I've simplified the cursor to be clean and intuitive:

### **New Simple Design**

1. **Normal State**:
   - Clean orange ring
   - Small center dot
   - Subtle pulse animation
   - No weird effects

2. **Dragging State**:
   - Ring gets slightly thicker (3px)
   - Adds a nice glow effect
   - Center dot turns white and grows
   - That's it - simple and clean!

3. **No Movement Indicators**:
   - No arrows
   - No shape morphing
   - No directional effects
   - Just a clean interactive cursor

## Visual Summary

**Before**: Complex shape morphing and directional indicators  
**Now**: Simple glow effect when dragging

## Why This Works Better

- **Clean**: No confusing visual effects
- **Clear**: Obviously interactive without being weird
- **Professional**: Subtle enhancements that feel polished
- **Intuitive**: Glows when active, simple as that

## Technical Changes

- Removed all movement tracking code
- Removed shape transformation CSS
- Simplified to just opacity and glow effects
- Kept the seamless infinite scroll unchanged

## Result

The cursor is now simple, clean, and professional. It provides clear feedback (glows when dragging) without any weird or confusing effects. Sometimes the best design is the simplest one!

Thanks for the honest feedback - this version is much better! ðŸŽ¯
