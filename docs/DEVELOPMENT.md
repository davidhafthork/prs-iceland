# Development Handbook

## Critical Information

**This is a PRODUCTION system for PRS Iceland**, not a demo or learning project. It manages real precision rifle competitions in Iceland.

## Documentation Rules

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses exactly TWO documentation files:
1. `/README.md` - Public-facing project overview
2. `/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - This file, containing all development information

**DO NOT CREATE** additional documentation files. All development notes, guides, session summaries, or technical documentation must be added to THIS FILE. No exceptions.

## Architecture Overview

### Content-First Design

This project uses a **content-first architecture** that separates content from presentation:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Pure presentation components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/             # All content as data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heroContent.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ matches.js    # Match data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ standings.js  # Competition data
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...           # Other content files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ site.js       # Site metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.js         # UI behavior config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ supabase.js   # Database operations
```

**Important**: The separation between static content (in `/data`) and dynamic data (from Supabase) is intentional. Don't change this.

### Database Schema
```sql
competitors (id, name, email, division, city)
matches (id, name, date, location, capacity, status)
registrations (match_id, competitor_id, status)
results (match_id, competitor_id, score, percentage, points)
```

### API Methods
```javascript
// From /src/lib/supabase.js
matchesApi.getUpcoming()     // Get upcoming matches
matchesApi.create()          // Create match (admin)
standingsApi.getCurrent()    // Get current standings
registrationApi.register()   // Register for match
resultsApi.addResults()      // Add results (admin)
```

## Development Rules

### 1. Keep It Simple
This replaces a chaotic Google Sheets system. Don't add complexity unless it solves a real problem for match organizers.

### 2. Preserve Architecture
- **Dynamic data** (matches, results) comes from Supabase
- **Static content** (hero, about, footer) stays in `/src/data` files
- This separation is intentional - don't change it

### 3. Test Everything
- Always run `npm run dev` and test locally
- Check `/test` route to verify database connection
- Never push untested database schema changes

### 4. Safe Operations
```bash
# Safe to run anytime
npm install
npm run dev

# Check before modifying
- Database schema (test migrations first)
- Authentication logic (affects all users)
- Production environment variables
```

## Quick Reference

### Routes
- `/` - Main website
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (unprotected)
- `/test` - Database connection tester
- `/debug` - Registration and data debug panel

### Key Files
- `/src/lib/supabase.js` - All database operations
- `/src/components/admin/*` - Admin interface
- `/src/components/RegistrationModal.jsx` - Registration form
- `/src/components/MatchRegistrations.jsx` - Participant list
- `/supabase/schema.sql` - Database structure
- `/supabase/rls_policies.sql` - Row Level Security policies
- `/supabase/SETUP.md` - Database setup instructions

### Environment
```bash
# .env.local (required)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```

## Content Management

Static content lives in `/src/data/`:
- Hero text, about descriptions, CTAs
- Navigation configuration
- Theme settings
- Feature flags

To update static content:
1. Navigate to `/src/data/`
2. Find the relevant content file
3. Update the JavaScript object
4. Changes appear instantly in dev mode

### Customization Options

**Theme** (`/src/config/ui.js`):
```javascript
export const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'orange-500',
    background: 'zinc-950'
  }
}
```

**Feature Flags** (`/src/config/ui.js`):
```javascript
export const featureFlags = {
  enableRegistration: true,
  showUpcomingMatches: true
}
```

## Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build    # Creates optimized build in /dist
npm run preview  # Test production build locally
```

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Set up authentication for admin routes
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [x] Enable RLS policies in Supabase (basic policies done)
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up monitoring/logging
- [ ] Add email notifications for registrations
- [ ] Implement proper error tracking

### Future Enhancements

The content-first architecture enables:
- **CMS Integration**: Connect to Strapi, Contentful, etc.
- **Internationalization**: Add English translations
- **Member Portal**: Add authentication and user features

## For AI Assistants

### Core Principle: Fix Problems at Lowest Value Stage
Always catch issues during planning, not after implementation:
1. **Plan thoroughly** before coding
2. **Validate approach** with small tests
3. **Question assumptions** early
4. **Review plans** before executing

Before suggesting changes:
1. Understand this is a real production system
2. Check if the feature already exists
3. Consider if it truly helps match organizers
4. Keep solutions simple and maintainable
5. **NEVER create new documentation files** - use only README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md

Never:
- Add complex features "just because"
- Make static content dynamic without good reason
- Modify database schema without migration planning
- Implement features not in the "What's Missing" list above
- **Create any documentation files beyond README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md**

### Planning Templates
Templates are available in `.claude/commands/`:
- `prs-feature.md` - Feature planning structure
- `prs-debug.md` - Debugging methodology

Use these as guides when planning work to ensure thorough thinking before implementation.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Registration RLS Error
If you get "new row violates row-level security policy":
1. Check that RLS policies are properly set in Supabase
2. Run the policies in `/supabase/rls_policies.sql`
3. Or temporarily disable RLS for development: `ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`

- Created `/supabase/rls_policies_registration_fix.sql` with:
  - DELETE policy for registrations
  - UPDATE policy for registrations
- Added debugging console logs to help identify issues
- **Action Required**: Run the new SQL file in Supabase to enable delete/update operations:
  ```sql
  -- Run in Supabase SQL editor after the main rls_policies.sql
  -- Contents of /supabase/rls_policies_registration_fix.sql
  ```

### July 2025 - Results and Complete Edit/Delete Fix
- Fixed "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" error for results updates
- Created comprehensive RLS policies file: `/supabase/rls_policies_complete_fix.sql`

- Added debugging to track ID issues
- **Action Required**: Run the complete fix SQL in Supabase:
  ```sql
  -- Run the contents of /supabase/rls_policies_complete_fix.sql in Supabase SQL editor
  -- This will fix all edit/delete operations across the admin panel
  ```
- **Important**: Check console logs to see if `competitor_id` is present in result objects

### July 2025 - Clarified Manual vs Calculated Fields
- Redesigned results entry to clearly distinguish between:
  - **Manual Input**: Score (raw points from competition)
  - **Auto-Calculated**: Percentage (score/max_score √ó 100)

- Added max score setting per match (default 300)
- Added toggle for manual vs automatic points calculation
- Visual indicators:
  - Required fields marked with orange asterisk
  - Calculated fields shown with gray background and "(reikna√∞)" label
  - Read-only fields have different styling
- Points calculation options:
  - **Automatic**: Based on final position (1st = 100p, 2nd = 95p, etc.)
  - **Manual**: Admin can enter custom points
- Added explanatory section showing what each field represents

### July 2025 - Admin Protection & Deployment Preparation
