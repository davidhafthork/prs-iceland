# Archived Old Workflows

This folder contains outdated AI workflow instructions that have been superseded by the Living Artifact approach.

## Why Archived?
These workflows were causing confusion as they prescribed a different approach (direct file editing with MCP Docker tools) than our current Living Artifact system where AI agents work within the artifact and humans execute the changes.

## Current Approach
The new approach uses the "PRS Iceland Refactoring - Living Project State" artifact as the single source of truth for all refactoring work.

## Files in this Archive

**DO NOT USE THESE WORKFLOWS** - They are kept only for historical reference.
