# About Section Fix - Text Visibility

## âœ… Fixed!

The about section text was invisible because:
1. Text started with `opacity: 0`
2. Relied on JavaScript animation to become visible
3. If animation didn't trigger, text stayed invisible

## ðŸ”§ Solution Applied

### Clean CSS Approach:
```css
/* Text is visible by default */
.about-content h2 {
    color: #333333;
    opacity: 1;  /* Always visible */
}

.about-content p {
    color: #666666;
    opacity: 1;  /* Always visible */
}

/* Animation only when JavaScript adds 'visible' class */
.about-content.visible h2 {
    animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease;
}
```

### Progressive Enhancement:
- âœ… Content visible without JavaScript
- âœ… Animations enhance the experience
- âœ… No dependency on animations for visibility
- âœ… Clean, professional approach

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

The about section text should now be:
- **Always visible** (dark text on white background)
- **Animated on scroll** (if JavaScript works)
- **Accessible** (even if animations fail)

This is the proper way to handle animations - content first, enhancements second!
